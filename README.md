A Yelp clone created using the MERN web stack. In addition to basic CRUD operations, users of the site can also search, rate, comment, favorite, and look up top rated stores.

Deep Dishes makes use of the Google Maps API to verify the address of restaurants submitted, and to provide a map of each store based on it's location.

MongoDB handles storage of all text based fields, while Amazon Web Services S3 is used for storing all images associated with restaurants.

Deep Dishes also features a fully fledged password reset system! Just click
the "Forgot my Password" button, and the app will email you a 1 hour valid password reset link.
